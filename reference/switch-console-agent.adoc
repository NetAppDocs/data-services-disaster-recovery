The NetApp Console supports using multiple Console agents with a single working environment. Using multiple Console agents can be helpful for maintaining access to resources while performing maitenance on another Console agent or if a Console agent fails. Because each Console agent has a unique identifier, improperly switching Console agents can compromise the availability of resources in a working environment. 

## Before you begin

* You must have xref:../get-started/dr-prerequisites.html#create-the-netapp-console-agent[added at least two Console agents for your working environment]. 
* Both Console agents must contain the same ONTAP clusters. 

## Steps

. In Disaster Recovery, select **Sites**.
. You must change the Console agent for both the source and destination vCenters. Identify the vCenters you want to modify. Select the action menu for the vCenter then **Edit**.

. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each additional vCenter you want to modify.
. In the vCenter that you modified, refresh the vCenter to discover the new Console agent. Repeat this step for every vCenter you've modified. 
. In Disaster Recovery, navigate to **Replication plans**.
. Identify the replication plans that you want to use to resume workflows. Select the action menu `...` then **Refresh resources**. You can monitor the status of the jobs in **Job monitoring**.
