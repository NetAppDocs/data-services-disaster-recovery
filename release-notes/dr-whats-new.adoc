=== Failover test schedules
This release includes updates to the failover test schedule structure, which was needed to support daily and weekly schedules. This update requires that you disable and re-enable all existing replication plans so that you will be able to use the new daily and weekly failover test schedules. This is a one-time requirement.  

Here's how: 

. From the menu, select *Replication plans*. 
. Select a plan and select the Actions icon to show the drop-down menu. 
. Select *Disable*. 
. After a few minutes, select *Enable*.

=== Replication plan updates
This release includes updates to replication plan data, which resolves a "snapshot not found" issue. This requires that you change the retention count in all replication plans to 1 and initiate an on-demand snapshot. This process creates a new backup and removes all older backups. 

Here's how: 

. From the menu, select *Replication plans*. 
. Select the replication plan, click the *Failover mapping* tab, and click the *Edit* pencil icon. 
. Click the *Datastores* arrow to expand it. 
//+
//image:use/dr-plan-failover-edit.png[Edit failover mappings page]
. Note the value of the retention count in the replication plan. You will need to reinstate this original value when you're finished with these steps. 
. Reduce the count to 1.
. Initiate an on-demand snapshot. To do so, on the Replication plan page, select the plan, click the Actions icon, and select *Take snapshot now*. 
. After the snapshot job completes successfully, increase the count in the replication plan back to its original value that you noted in the first step. 
. Repeat these steps for all existing replication plans.

== 01 February 2024

This NetApp Disaster Recovery preview release includes the following updates: 

=== Network enhancement
With this release, you can now resize the VM CPU and RAM values. You can also now select a network DHCP or static IP address for the VM.  

** DHCP: If you choose this option, you provide credentials for the VM. 
** Static IP: You can select the same or different information from the source VM. If you choose the same as the source, you do not need to enter credentials. On the other hand, if you choose to use different information from the source, you can provide the credentials, IP address, subnet mask, DNS, and gateway information.  

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


=== Custom scripts
Can now be included as post failover processes. With custom scripts, you can have NetApp Disaster Recovery run your script after a failover process. For example, you can use a custom script to resume all database transactions after the failover is complete.  
//to pause all database transactions before a failover 

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/failover.html[Fail over to a remote site].


=== SnapMirror relationship 
You can now create a SnapMirror relationship while developing the replication plan. Previously, you had to create the relationship outside of NetApp Disaster Recovery. 

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


=== Consistency groups
When you create a replication plan, you can include VMs that are from different volumes and different SVMs. NetApp Disaster Recovery creates a Consistency Group Snapshot by including all the volumes and updates all the secondary locations. 

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


=== VM power-on delay option
When you create a replication plan, you can add VMs to a Resource Group. With Resource Groups, you can set a delay on each VM so that they power up on a delayed sequence. 

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


=== Application-consistent Snapshot copies
You can specify to create application-consistent Snapshot copies. The service will quiesce the application and then take a Snapshot to obtain a consistent state of the application. 

For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

=== Replication plan updates
** *RPO*: You can now enter the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Retention count in the Datastores section of the Replication plan. This indicates the amount of data that must exist that is not older than the set time. If, for example, you set it at 5 minutes, the system can lose up to 5 minutes of data if thereâ€™s a disaster without impacting business critical needs. 
+
Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


** *Networking enhancements*: When you are mapping networking between source and target locations in the virtual machines section of the replication plan, NetApp Disaster Recovery now offers two options: DHCP or static IP.

== 01 August 2023

=== NetApp Disaster Recovery preview
NetApp Disaster Recovery preview is a cloud-based disaster recovery service that automates disaster recovery workflows. Initially, with the NetApp Disaster Recovery preview, you can protect your on-premises, NFS-based VMware workloads running NetApp storage to VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS with Amazon FSx for ONTAP. 

NOTE: With this preview offering, NetApp reserves the right to modify offering details, contents and timeline before General Availability.   

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/get-started/dr-intro.html[Learn more about NetApp Disaster Recovery]. 

This release includes the following updates: 

=== Resource groups update for boot order
When you create a disaster recovery or replication plan, you can add virtual machines into functional resource groups. Resource groups enable you to put a set of dependent virtual machines into logical groups that meet your requirements. For example, groups could contain boot order that can be executed upon recovery. With this release, each resource group can include one or more virtual machines. The virtual machines will power on based on the sequence in which you include them in the plan. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html#select-applications-to-replicate-and-assign-resource-groups[Select applications to replicate and assign resource groups].
 


=== Replication verification
After you create the disaster recovery or replication plan, identify the recurrence in the wizard, and initiate a replication to a disaster recovery site, every 30 minutes NetApp Disaster Recovery verifies that the replication is actually occurring according to the plan. You can monitor the progress in the Job Monitor page. Refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/replicate.html[Replicate applications to another site].

=== Replication plan shows recovery point objective (RPO) transfer schedules
When you create a disaster recovery or replication plan, you select the VMs. In this release, you can now view the SnapMirror associated with each of the volumes that are associated with the datastore or VM. You can also see the RPO transfer schedules that are associated with the SnapMirror schedule. RPO helps you determine whether your backup schedule is enough to recover after a disaster. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

=== Job Monitor update
The Job Monitor page now includes a Refresh option so that you can get an up-to-date status of operations. Refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/monitor-jobs.html[Monitor disaster recovery jobs].

== 18 May 2023
