Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the service, or that do not interoperate correctly with it.

== Wait until failback completes before running discovery

After a failover has finished, do not initiate discovery on the source vCenter manually. Wait until the failback has finished and then initiate discovery on the source vCenter.

== NetApp Console might not discover Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

Sometimes, the NetApp Console does not discover Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP clusters. This might be because the FSx credentials were not correct.

*Workaround*: Add the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP cluster in the NetApp Console and periodically refresh the cluster to display any changes.

If you need to remove the ONTAP FSx cluster from NetApp Disaster Recovery, complete the following steps: 

. In the NetApp Console agent, use the connectivity options from your cloud provider, connect to the Linux VM that the Console agent runs on, restart the "occm" service using the `docker restart occm` command.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html#connect-to-the-linux-vm[Manage existing Console agents^].           

. In the NetApp Console Systems page, add the Amazon FSx for ONTAP system again and provide the FSx credentials.

Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/getting-started-step1.html[Create an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system^].

. From NetApp Disaster Recovery, select *Sites*, on the vCenter row select the *Actions* option image:../use/icon-vertical-dots.png[Actions menu icon in NetApp Disaster Recovery], and from the Actions menu, select *Refresh* to refresh the FSx discovery in NetApp Disaster Recovery.

This rediscovers the datastore, its virtual machines, and its destination relationship.
