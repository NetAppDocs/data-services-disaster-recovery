=== Intelligent proxy support 

The NetApp Console agent supports intelligent proxy. Intelligent proxy is a lightweight, secure, and efficient way to connect your on-premises system to NetApp Disaster Recovery. It provides a secure connection between your system and NetApp Disaster Recovery without requiring a VPN or direct internet access. This optimized proxy implementation offloads API traffic within the local network.

When a proxy is configured, NetApp Disaster Recovery attempts to communicate directly with VMware or ONTAP and uses the configured proxy if direct communication fails.

NetApp Disaster Recovery proxy implementation requires port 443 communication between the Console agent and any vCenter Servers and ONTAP arrays using an HTTPS protocol. The NetApp Disaster Recovery agent within the Console agent communicates directly with VMware vSphere, the VC, or ONTAP when performing any actions.
