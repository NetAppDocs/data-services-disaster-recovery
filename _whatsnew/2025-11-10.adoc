=== Cascading failover support

You can now configure a cascading relationship in ONTAP and use any leg of that replication relationship for disaster recovery. 

=== Downgrade VMware hardware support during registration

Disaster Recovery now supports downgrading VMware hardware to an earlier version of vSphere during registration. This is useful when the source ESX host is running a later version than the disaster recovery location. 

=== Graceful shut down

Disaster Recovery now gracefully shuts down VMs instead of powering them off. If a given VM takes more than ten minutes to power down, Disaster Recovery powers it off. 

==== Pre-backup scripting support

Pre-backup support allows customers to control the state of the VM before the snapshot is replicated. 

You can now inject custom scripting into the failover workflow to run before before creating a backup. Pre-backup scripting enables you to control the VM's state before a snapshot is replicated and prepare a VM for a transition. For example, you can inject a script that unmounts an NFS mount that will be remounted using a different script after failover.
