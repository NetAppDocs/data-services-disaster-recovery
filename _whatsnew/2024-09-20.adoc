=== Support for on-premises to on-premises VMware VMFS datastores
This release includes support for VMs mounted on VMware vSphere virtual machine file system (VMFS) datastores for iSCSI and FC protected to on-premises storage. Previously, the service provided a _technology preview_ supporting VMFS datastores for iSCSI and FC.  

Here are some additional considerations regarding both iSCSI and FC protocols: 

** FC support is for client front-end protocols, not for replication. 
** NetApp Disaster Recovery supports only a single LUN per ONTAP volume. The volume should not have multiple LUNs. 
** For any replication plan, the destination ONTAP volume should use the same protocols as the source ONTAP volume hosting the protected VMs. For example, if the source uses an FC protocol, the destination should also use FC.
