=== Folder hierarchy retention

By default, Disaster Recovery retains the VM inventory hierarchy (folder structure) on failover. If the recovery target doesn't have the required folder, Disaster Recovery creates it.

You can now override this setting by designating a new parent VM folder or by unchecking the **Retain original folder hierarchy** option.

=== Streamlined Console agent updating 

Disaster Recovery now supports a streamlined process for using multiple Console agents in a working environment. To switch between Console agents, you must edit your vCenter configuration, rediscover the credentials, and refresh the replication plans to use the new Console agent.
