After a disaster has been resolved, fail back from the disaster recovery site to the source site to return to normal operations. You can select the snapshot from which to recover. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, Disaster recovery admin, or Disaster recovery failover admin role.

*About this task*

In this workflow, NetApp Disaster Recovery replicates (resyncs) any changes back to the original source virtual machine before reversing the replication direction. This process starts from a relationship that has completed failing over to a target and involves the following steps:

* Perform a compliance check on the recovered site. 
* Refresh the vCenter information for each vCenter cluster identified as located in the recovered site. 
* On the target site, power off and unregister the virtual machines, and unmount volumes.  
* Break the SnapMirror relationship on the original source to make it read/write.
* Resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship to reverse the replication.
* Power on and register the source virtual machines, and mount the volumes on the source.
