After a disaster has been resolved, fail back from the disaster recovery site to the source site to return to normal operations. You can select the snapshot from which to recover. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, Disaster recovery admin, or Disaster recovery failover admin role.

In this workflow, NetApp Disaster Recovery replicates (resyncs) any changes back to the original source virtual machine before reversing the replication direction. This process starts from a relationship that has completed failing over to a target and involves the following steps:

* On the target site, the virtual machines are powered off and unregistered, and volumes are unmounted.  
* The SnapMirror relationship on the original source is broken to make it read/write.
* The SnapMirror relationship is resynchronized to reverse the replication.
* The source virtual machines are powered on and registered, and volumes are mounted on the source.
