* When you're creating a replication plan and creating a resource group within the plan, you can see the VMs in the datastores. 

You can also edit and delete resource groups. 

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Resource groups*. 
. To add a resource group, select *Add group*.  
. To perform actions with the resource group, select the *Actions* option image:../use/icon-horizontal-dots.png[Actions menu icon in NetApp Disaster Recovery service]  at the right and select any of the options, such as *Edit resource group* or *Delete resource group*. 

== Manage replication plans 

You can disable, enable and delete replication plans. You can change schedules. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, Disaster recovery admin, Disaster recovery failover admin, or Disaster recovery application admin role.


* If you want to pause a replication plan temporarily, you can disable it and later enable it.

You can reconcile snapshots that are out of sync between the source and target. This might occur if snapshots are deleted on a target outside of NetApp Disaster Recovery.

This feature enables you to ensure that the snapshots are consistent across all sites.
